                Hello, let me present you, my name is Raffaele Aveta, I’m 25 years old and I’m from Italy, from Caserta,
                a
                city near Naples.
                My two biggest passions are connected among themselves, in fact they are technology and most
                specifically
                web development.
                Since I was a young boy I’ve always been attracted to all the world that goes around these two main
                things,
                most of all because it’s amazing to think how life can be (and it is) better just with the help of
                something
                that’s on the internet or something that is made by technology! I mean it’s insane where life is going
                and
                where the world is going!
                When I was a child my parents gave me as a present a programming language book, and since then it was
                “love
                at first line!” (as it’s usual to say in technical words).
                Thanks to all that, I’ve started my web developer full stack studies, going also through web design. All
                that because I truly believe that a good web developer should know both aspects of the web to be able to
                do
                his job at 360 degrees. A basically example can be the importance of knowing both the back and front
                end,
                the first to fully understand how servers and websites interact among themselves, and the second to
                develop
                designs and ways to make easy to use a website for all the people, everywhere.
                So to flank my web developer formation, as I already said, there are also web design studies because I’m
                truly interested in giving to my clientele all the best experience they can have and also totally
                interact
                with my teamwork.
                I’m also an art enthusiast in general, in fact my academic career is made by an art high school diploma
                and
                lots of certificates, always regarding arts. For example I’ve done a tattoos and piercings course, that
                allowed me to totally express myself and my personal art, most of all because with this work you have to
                be
                fully connected with the other’s minds to be really connected to what they really want.
                As it’s easy to deduce by these lines, I’m a dynamic person, I really love to better myself with every
                single thing is under my possession. I love and I want to continue to improve my mind and my cultural
                experience, filling it by concepts and technological skills, just to make everything of that available
                to
                every company I work with.
                At the completion of my skills there are a good inclination to teamwork, a really good relational
                quality,
                thanks to my many works experiences that formed me, and also a marked organizational skill that
                obviously is
                always essential.
                The major softwares I use are Git, Visual Studio Code, WordPress, Photoshop, Lightroom, Sketchbook.
                I give the best of me in active contexts and I feel comfortable in difficult circumstances, they give me
                the
                strength to always give the best.
